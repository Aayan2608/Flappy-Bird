# Flappy-Bird
This project is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them.

# Gameplay
The goal of the game is to keep the bird flying as long as possible without hitting the pipes or the ground. The bird falls due to gravity and you can make it flap its wings to ascend.

# Controls
